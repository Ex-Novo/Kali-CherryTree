# Penetration-Testing-Notes

 Before getting started in this project: You need KeepNote to open the "notebook.nbk" file, located in:
"Pentesting Checklist/notebook.nbk"
 http://keepnote.org/




 "Penetration-Testing-Notes" are simply notes for Penetration Testing.
 Everytime I learn something new into Pentesting field, I add it to this repo.
 This checklist will include A LOT of topic: basics, reminders, to-do list, examples etc.
 I even add some notes from online courses, so I will not forget them.
 
 When this project will grow in size and content, I will create more specific repositories,
 starting from this one:
 E.G. I can create a specific checklist to attack a protocol or a Web Server or Post-Exploitation for Windows
 
 
 You can send more suggestions like: courses, sources and even credits (if needed)
 Or (even better) ask me for suggestion or courses to follow!!!
 
 I hope will help: share with others, fork the project, send requests!!!
