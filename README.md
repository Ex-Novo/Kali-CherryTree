 Before getting started: You need Cherry Tree to open .ctd files

 "Pentesting-Checklist" is a simple checklist for Kali Linux and Pentesting.
 Everytime I learn something new for Pentesting, I add it to this repo.
 This checklist will include A LOT of topic: basics, reminders, to-do list etc.
 
 You can commit your suggestions or changes to the branch "changes"
 
 I hope will help: share to others or edit to improve the repo <3
