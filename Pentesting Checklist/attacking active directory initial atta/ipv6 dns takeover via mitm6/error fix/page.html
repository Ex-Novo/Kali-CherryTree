This is not a question but a solution to help if others face a similar problem.<br/>
<br/>
When I ran the ntlmrelay.py and mitm6.py commands, I couldn't capture any information about the relay got stuck on this output:<br/>
<br/>
```<br/>
<br/>
[*] Servers started, waiting for connections<br/>
<br/>
[*] HTTPD: Received connection from ::ffff:172.16.223.134, attacking target ldaps://172.16.223.133<br/>
<br/>
[*] HTTPD: Client requested path: /wpad.dat<br/>
<br/>
[*] HTTPD: Client requested path: /wpad.dat<br/>
<br/>
[*] HTTPD: Serving PAC file to client ::ffff:172.16.223.134<br/>
<br/>
```<br/>
<br/>
The solution was just a lack of depedences, installing these things and re-run the commands to get correct output:<br/>
<br/>
```<br/>
<br/>
apt update<br/>
<br/>
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev<br/>
<br/>
sudo pip install service_identity<br/>
<br/>
```</body></html>
